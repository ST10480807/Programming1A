3️⃣ Commit and push to GitHub
If your project is already a Git repository:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated tests"
git push origin main
If you haven’t created a Git repo yet:

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with POE2 tests and workflow"
# Replace URL with your GitHub repo URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
4️⃣ Check GitHub Actions
Go to your GitHub repository in a browser.

Click Actions tab.

You should see a workflow called “Java CI” running automatically.

Once it finishes, you can click the run to see test results.

✅ If all your tests pass, your rubric requirement is fully satisfied.

If you want, I can also give you a very simple visual guide showing exactly where to click and paste files in GitHub’s web interface, so you don’t need to use the terminal at all.

Do you want me to do that?







You said:
must i create the folders directly from the desktop or from netbeans


ChatGPT said:
You can do it either way, but for a NetBeans project it’s usually easier and safer to do it from within NetBeans so it integrates correctly with your project structure. Here’s how to do it step by step:

Option 1: Using NetBeans (Recommended)
Open your project in NetBeans.

In the Projects view, right-click on your project and select New → Folder.

Name the folder .github and click Finish.

Right-click the .github folder → New → Folder → name it workflows.

Right-click the workflows folder → New → Empty File → name it TestJava.yml.

Copy-paste the workflow YAML I gave you into this file.

Save the file.

Now the folder structure in NetBeans will look like this:

markdown
Copy code
your-project/
└─ .github/
   └─ workflows/
      └─ TestJava.yml
Option 2: Using File Explorer/Desktop
Navigate to your project folder.

Create a folder called .github.

Inside .github, create another folder called workflows.

Create a text file inside workflows called TestJava.yml.

Open it in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.) and paste the YAML.

Note: Files starting with a dot (.github) may be hidden in File Explorer, so make sure “Show hidden files” is enabled.

✅ After creating the workflow
Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub.

GitHub Actions will detect the .github/workflows/TestJava.yml file automatically.

Your tests (POE2Test.java) will run on every push.

If you want, I can make a tiny visual step-by-step guide showing exactly what to click in NetBeans to create the folders and YAML. That makes it nearly impossible to mess up.

Do you want me to make that guide?
